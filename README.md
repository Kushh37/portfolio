# Data Engineer Portfolio

Greetings! My name is Heet, and I'm excited to share my still developing data engineer portfolio. Within this repository, you'll find a comprehensive catalog of projects completed in various data analytics/ engineering courses or self development exercises, each of which covers essential skills and techniques.

### [Web Scrapping and Automation Bots - puppeteer](https://github.com/Kushh37/Web-Scrapping-and-Automation-Bots)

- Brief overview:   JavaScript (Puppeteer) used to extract realtor data from private sources in Canada, create a dataset with all realtors, and export it into Excel format.  
- Technology used: *JavaScript, Puppeteer, Excel*  
- Final results: [*output dataset (output.xlsx)*](https://github.com/Kushh37/Web-Scrapping-and-Automation-Bots/blob/main/output.xlsx) 

### [Cricket Data Engineering Lakehouse](https://github.com/Kushh37/Cricket-Data-Engineering-Lakehouse)

- Brief overview: This project is a comprehensive data engineering solution for cricket data, built on Azure Databricks and Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS). Following a Medallion Architecture, it automates the ingestion, transformation, and refinement of raw cricket data (JSON files) into a structured, query-ready Delta Lake. Key achievements include building a scalable data pipeline, implementing data governance with Unity Catalog, and laying the groundwork for advanced analytics and machine learning.
- Technology Used: Azure Databricks, Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS), Delta Lake, PySpark, SQL, Unity Catalog, Azure Key Vault
- Key Achievements:
  - Designed and implemented a robust data pipeline that transforms nested JSON data into a series of normalized Delta tables.
  - Utilized Databricks Auto Loader to efficiently handle incremental data ingestion, ensuring the pipeline can process new data files as they arrive.
  - Applied best practices for performance optimization, including Z-ordering and strategic partitioning (by season then match_id), to accelerate query performance.
  - Enabled Optimized Writes and Auto-Compaction to reduce small file issues and improve read performance.
